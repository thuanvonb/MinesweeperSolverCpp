## Minesweeper solver

This is a Minesweeper solver programmed in C++. It is a side-project of one of my future projects about Minesweeper. 
The solver is capable of solving which cells are safe, and which cells contain mine.
It is also be able to calculate the probability of a cell containing a mine using math and some backtracking techniques.

In the future, I will implement an algorithm that calculates the probability of each number will appear if the cell doesn't contain mine.
I also want to make my solver be able to do some winning probability calculations in the end-game.
